1.  Introduction

   A key and signing policy (KASP) defines a DNSSEC [RFC4033] [RFC4034]
   [RFC4035] policy for one or more zones.

1.1.  Key Words

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY" and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119].

1.2.  Terminology

   The reader is assumed to be familiar with DNSSEC described in
   [RFC4033] [RFC4034] [RFC4035], [RFC5155] and [RFC6781].

   The following terminology is used throughout this document:

   KASP:  Key And Signing Policy, describes a DNSSEC policy that can be
      applied to one or more zones.

   A key and signing policy can be expressed in any format.  This
   document uses XML as example.

1.3.  Data Modeling

   This document reuses the modeling types described in [RFC6020].

   The following modeling types are used:

   container:  A container.

   list:  A list.

   leaf:  A leaf node.

   leaf-list:  A list.

   choice:  A choice.

   case:  A choice option.

   The following arguments are used:

   string:  A string.

   duration:  A duration.

   empty:  An empty type.

2.  KASP Contents

2.1.  Preamble

   All policies MUST be enclosed in a KASP container.

   container KASP {
       ...
   }

   A KASP container MUST contain a sequence of policy entries and MUST
   NOT contain any other modeling types.

2.1.1.  Policies

   Each policy MUST have a "name" leaf which contains the name of the
   policy.  The name is used to link a policy and the zones signed using
   it; each policy MUST have a unique name.  A policy named "default"
   MAY be used to associate with all zones that do not have a policy
   explicitly configured.  A policy MUST have a description associated
   with it.  Furthermore, a policy MUST have the containers Signatures,
   Denial, Keys, Zone and Parent.  These containers are described in the
   forthcoming sections.

   list Policy {
       key "name";
       leaf name { type string; }
       leaf description { type string; }
       container Signatures { ... }
       container Denial { ... }
       container Keys { ... }
       container Zone { ... }
       container Parent { ... }
   }

2.1.1.1.  Signatures

   A Signatures container defines the policy parameters for creating
   RRSIG records and MUST be included.  It MUST contain the following
   leaf nodes: Resign, Refresh, Jitter, InceptionOffset.  It MUST
   contain a Validity container that includes leaf nodes for the
   validity periods of certain type of RRsets.  The Default leaf node
   sets the validity period for all RRsets that do not have a specific
   leaf node in this Validity container.  The Denial leaf node sets the
   validity period for all NSEC and NSEC3 RRsets.

   The Validity container MUST include leaf nodes Default and Denial and
   MAY include other leaf nodes to differentiate between even more types
   of RRsets.

   container Signatures {
       leaf Resign { type duration; }
       leaf Refresh { type duration; }
       leaf Jitter { type duration; }
       leaf InceptionOffset { type duration; }
       container Validity {
           leaf Default { type duration; }
           leaf Denial { type duration; }
       }
   }

   Here:

   1.  Resign - the re-sign interval, which is the interval when the
       signer MUST re-sign the zone.

   2.  Refresh - the refresh interval, detailing when a signature MUST
       be refreshed.  As signatures are typically valid for much longer
       than the interval between runs of the signer, there is no need to
       re-generate the signatures each time the signer runs.  The
       signature MUST be refreshed when the time until the signature
       expiration is closer than the refresh interval or when the data

       has been changed.  A value of zero (PT0S) MUST be interpreted as
       to refresh the signatures each re-sign interval.

   3.  Jitter - the value added to the expiration time of signatures to
       ensure that not all signatures expire at the same time.  The
       actual value of Jitter to be added MUST be -j + (r % 2j), where j
       is the jitter value from the policy and r a random duration,
       uniformly ranging between -j and j, is added to signature
       validity period to get the signature expiration time.

   4.  InceptionOffset - a duration that MUST be subtracted from the
       time at which a record is signed to give the start time of the
       record.  This is required to allow for clock skew between the
       signing system and the system on which the signature is checked.
       Without it, the possibility exists that the checking system could
       retrieve a signature whose start time is later than the current
       time.

   5.  Validity - groups two or more elements of information related to
       how long the signatures are valid for - Denial is the validity
       period for all NSEC and NSEC3 RRsets, Default is the validity
       period for all other RRset.

   The relationship between these elements is shown [RFC6781],
   Figure 11.

2.1.1.2.  Authenticated Denial of Existence

   Authenticated denial of existence information is included within a
   Denial container.  It MUST contain either an empty leaf node NSEC or
   a container NSEC3.  A NSEC3 container MUST include a leaf node Resalt
   and MUST include a container Hash.  Additionally, it MAY include TTL
   and OptOut leaf nodes.

   The Hash container MUST include three leaf nodes: Algorithm,
   Iterations and SaltLength [MM: kasp.xml uses Salt, but it is actually
   only needed in signconf.xml].

Internet-Draft                    KASP                         June 2014


   container Denial {
       choice RRtype {
           case plain {
               leaf NSEC { type empty; }
           }
           case hashed {
               container NSEC3 {
                   leaf TTL { type duration; }
                   leaf OptOut { type empty; }
                   leaf Resalt { type duration; }
                   container Hash {
                       leaf Algorithm { type integer; }
                       leaf Iterations { type integer; }
                       leaf SaltLength { type integer; }
                   }
               }
           }
       }

   If NSEC is used, zones with this policy MUST include NSEC records
   when signing the zone.  If NSEC3 is used, zones with this policy MUST
   include NSEC3 and NSEC3PARAM records with the appropriate policy
   values:

   1.  TTL - if present, the TTL for the NSEC3PARAM resource record MUST
       be set to this value.  If not present, PT0S (0) SHOULD be used as
       TTL.

   2.  OptOut - if present, all included NSEC3 records SHOULD set the
       Opt-Out bit.  The signer SHOULD NOT include NSEC3 records for
       insecure delegations.

   3.  Resalt - A new salt value MUST be generated each Resalt interval
       value.

   4.  Algorithm, Iterations, SaltLength MUST be used as the parameters
       to the hash algorithm.

   The choice and case modeling types are not included in the actual
   data tree.  In the case that NSEC is used, the XML example would be:

   <Denial>
       <NSEC/>
   </Denial>

2.1.1.3.  Keys

   Parameters relating to keys can be found in Keys container.  This
   container MUST include ...

   <TTL>PT3600S</TTL>
   <RetireSafety>PT3600S</RetireSafety>
   <PublishSafety>PT3600S</PublishSafety>
   <ShareKeys/>
   <Purge>P14D</Purge>

   <TTL> is the time-to-live value for the DNSKEY resource records.
   <PublishSafety> and <RetireSafety> are the publish and retire safety
   margins for the keys.  These intervals are safety margins added to
   calculated timing values to give some extra time to cover unforeseen
   events, e.g. in case external events prevent zone publication.

   If multiple zones are associated with a policy, the presence of
   <ShareKeys/> indicates that a key can be shared between zones.

   If <Purge> is present, keys marked as dead will be automatically
   purged from the database after this interval.

   Key-Signing Keys

   Parameters for key-signing keys are held in the <KSK> section:

   <KSK>
       <Algorithm length="2048">8</Algorithm>
       <Lifetime>P1Y</Lifetime>
       <Repository>softHSM</Repository>
       <Standby>1</Standby>
       <ManualRollover/>
   </KSK>

   where:

   1.  <Algorithm> - determines the algorithm used for the key

   2.  <Lifetime> - determines how long the key is used for before it is
       rolled.

   3.  <Repository> - determines the location of the keys.  Keys are
       stored in "repositories"

   4.  <Standby> - if present, determines the number of standby keys
       held in the zone.

Internet-Draft                    KASP                         June 2014


   5.  <ManualRollover/> - if present, this indicates that the key
       rollover will only be initiated on the command by the operator.

   Zone-Signing Keys

   Parameters for zone-signing keys are held in the <ZSK> section, and
   have the same meaning as for the KSK:

   <ZSK>
       <Algorithm length="1024">8</Algorithm>
       <Lifetime>P90D</Lifetime>
       <Repository>softHSM</Repository>
       <Standby>1</Standby>
   </ZSK>

   [MM: Does enforcer 2.0 change this (CSK, Different rollover
   scenarios, ...)]

2.1.1.4.  Zone

   The Zone container encloses general information concerning the zone.

   <Zone>
       <PropagationDelay>PT9999S</PropagationDelay>
       <SOA>
           <TTL>PT3600S</TTL>
           <Minimum>PT3600S</Minimum>
           <Serial>unixtime</Serial>
       </SOA>
   </Zone>

   <PropagationDelay> is the amount of time needed for information
   changes at the master server for the zone to work its way through to
   all the secondary nameservers.

   The <SOA> element gives values of parameters for the SOA record in
   the signed zone.

   The SOA values will override values set for the SOA record in the
   input zone file and the serial in signed and unsigned zone is likely
   to go out of sync.

   These SOA values are:

   1.  <TTL> - TTL of the SOA record.

   2.  <Minimum> - value for the SOA MINIMUM parameter.

Internet-Draft                    KASP                         June 2014


   3.  <Serial> - the format of the serial number in the signed zone.
       This is one of: counter, datecounter, unixtime, keep.

2.1.1.5.  Parent

   If a DNSSEC zone is in a chain of trust, digest information about the
   KSKs used in the zone will be stored in DS records in the parent
   zone.  To properly roll keys, timing information about the parent
   zone must be configured in the <Parent> section:

   <Parent>
       <PropagationDelay>PT9999S</PropagationDelay>
       <DS>
           <TTL>PT3600S</TTL>
       </DS>
       <SOA>
           <TTL>PT3600S</TTL>
           <Minimum>PT3600S</Minimum>
       </SOA>
   </Parent>

   <PropagationDelay> is the interval between the time a new KSK is
   published in the zone and the time that the DS record appears in the
   parent zone.

   The <DS> tag holds information about the DS record in the parent.  It
   contains a single element, <TTL>, which should be set to the TTL of
   the DS record in the parent zone.

   <SOA> gives information about parameters of the parent's SOA record,
   used by KASP in its calculations.  As before, <TTL> is the TTL of the
   SOA record and <Minimum> is the value of the SOA MINIMUM parameter.
